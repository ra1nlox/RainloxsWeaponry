# RainloxsWeaponry

Plugin for some sort of awful weapon that is actually clay ball xD.

## Usage:
  1. Craft weapon. Sadly i don't did visual crafts to better understanding how to craft them, but you can see the source code, so you can figure it out.
  2. Craft ammo.
  3. Put your weapon in off hand and the ammo in main hand.
  4. Right click it!
  5. Weapon should be placed in an empty slot in your inventory.
  6. With weapon in main hand you can shoot with left click.
  
Also weapon don't have any texture so you can made it by your self.

P.S oohh, I hope this plugin will go unnoticed...
